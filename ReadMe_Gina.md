# Robot Dance Battle 
## What I Used
- **Microbit with Wukong Extension**: The brain of the robot, used to control everything.
- **LEGO Bricks**: Used to build the robot's body.
- **Motors**:
  - **1 Motors for the Legs**: These help the robot move its legs to dance.
  - **1 Motor for the Arms**: This motor makes the arms move during the dance.
- **1 Servo Motor for the Waist**: This helps the robot bend over.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: it will change dances if triggered

## What I Changed
1. **LEGO Body**: I built a custom body for the robot using LEGO bricks.
2. **Extra Motors**: I added motors for the legs and arms.
3. **Ultrasonic Sensor**: I added the sensor so the robot can detect objects and change its moves.
